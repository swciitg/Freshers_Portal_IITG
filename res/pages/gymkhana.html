				<h1>Students' Senate</h1>
				<p style="padding:25px;text-align:justify">At IIT Guwahati,  this structure of Students' Senate was implemented for the first time in 2014-15.

In other words, students' senate represent each student in the campus. <br><br>What is the structure of Students' Senate?<br>Students' Senate consists of 23 elected student representatives:<br><br>Executive Panel<br>-Vice President, Students' Gymkhana Council<br>-General Secretary, Students' Welfare Board<br>-General Secretary, Sports Board<br>-General Secretary, Cultural Board<br>-General Secretary, Technical Board<br>-General Secretary, Hostel Affairs Board<br><br>Legislative Panel<br>-7 UG (Undergraduate) Senators<br>-7 PG (Postgraduate) Senators<br>-3 Girl Senators<br><br>
				<strong>How does Students' Senate function?</strong><br>Students' Senate acts as a bridge between the student community and the administration. Senate meets once every month where discussion are done and decisions are made upon the proposal drafted by the senators on the issues put forward by the student community through the form circulated online before the meeting.<br>Depending upon the type of the proposal, they are drafted and submitted to the concerned department or are put forward in SAC(Students Affairs Council) by the Vice President, who is the chairman of students' senate and joint secretary at the SAC meeting.<br><br><strong>How easy it is to put forward your point in the agenda for the meeting?</strong><br>You can put agenda in the google form that is circulated each month. To give a detailed information of your proposal, you can call up a senator, sit with him so that he can put forward your point in the meeting which goes into action on approval by the Studnets' Senate. Senators will be happy to help you always. Just give them a call in case of help.</p>
