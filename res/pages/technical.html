			<p>The Technical Board, since its inception has grown both in size, with people joining it over the years and in dimension as the people belonging to this board come up with new ideas, diversified work and the zeal of making a greater impact. The board promotes innovation and thinking out of the box. It has ever been ready to absorb the technological innovations and to mold itself in such a way which suits best to the necessary technical requirements/opportunities of the students belonging to this technical institute.<br>The primary goal of the board has been to equip students with the motivation, required interest, tools and a platform challenging enough to demonstrate and showcase their skills. This has a direct influence on the growth and development of the institute as a whole. Filling up the quota of curiosity that students have within themselves with regular intervals of technical quanta sets the wheel in motion which eventually creates the much needed culture. It is the establishment of this culture that we had in mind and which the board will be continuing to focus on.</p>
