				<div class="question">What are the medical facilities provided in IIT Guwahati?</div>
				<div class="answer"><p>We have an in-campus hospital at IIT Guwahati, which is open 24×7. In case of emergency the IIT Guwahati ambulance drives you to the hospital. You call them directly or approach the nearest security desk to summon them. In case it is a serious matter which cannot be handled by the staff at the IIT Guwahati hospital at that time, the students are referred to GNRC or NH Narayana Hospital  which are located very close to the campus. The IIT Guwahati ambulance will drop you there in case of an emergency free of charge. Also, during the orientation week, you will all be given a Health Record Card will guarantee you free of charge treatment and medication at the Institute Hospital.</p></div>
